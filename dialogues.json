        "text": "Creating a simulation for a double pendulum in Python is a complex task that involves physics and numerical methods for solving differential equations. To simulate a double pendulum, we'll need to use the equations of motion for the system. We can use libraries such as `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for animation.\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how we can approach this:\n\n1. Define the equations of motion for the double pendulum.\n2. Implement a numerical solver to solve these equations over time.\n3. Visualize the motion of the double pendulum.\n\nBefore we start coding, do you have any specific requirements for the simulation, such as:\n- The initial conditions (angles and angular velocities of the pendulums)?\n- The lengths and masses of the pendulum rods?\n- The duration of the simulation and the time step for the numerical integration?\n- Any specific numerical method you'd like to use (e.g., Runge-Kutta)?\n- Any specific visualization requirements (e.g., real-time animation, saving to a file, etc.)?\n\nPlease provide these details so that we can create a tailored solution for you.",
