        "text": "Creating a simulation for a double pendulum in Python is a complex task that involves physics and numerical methods for solving differential equations. To simulate a double pendulum, we'll need to use the equations of motion for the system. We can use libraries such as `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for animation.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how we can approach this:

1. Define the equations of motion for the double pendulum.
2. Implement a numerical solver to solve these equations over time.
3. Visualize the motion of the double pendulum.

Before we start coding, do you have any specific requirements for the simulation, such as:
- The initial conditions (angles and angular velocities of the pendulums)?
- The lengths and masses of the pendulum rods?
- The duration of the simulation and the time step for the numerical integration?
- Any specific numerical method you'd like to use (e.g., Runge-Kutta)?
- Any specific visualization requirements (e.g., real-time animation, saving to a file, etc.)?

Please provide these details so that we can create a tailored solution for you.",
